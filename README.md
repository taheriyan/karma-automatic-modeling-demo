=============================

This repository includes the files required to demonstrate automatic modeling in Karma.

#### Instructions to run the demo:

* Load dataset/s05-met.json in Karma
* Apply previously built model for this source by clicking on "Apply R2RML Model" and then selecting models-autosave/s05-met.json-model.ttl
* Publish this model
* Load dataset/s12-s-19-artworks.json in Karma
* Click on "Suggest Model" (Using Current Ontologies) to see what Karma proposes as a semantic model for the new source
* Compare the suggested model to the correct model of the source at screenshot/s12-s-19-artworks.json.png (or models-graphviz/s12-s-19-artworks.json.model.dot)
